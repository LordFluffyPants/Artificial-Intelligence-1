A) Can a simple reflex agent be perfectly rational for this environment?
    A simple reflex agent would not work for the new modified version of the agent. This is because the agent does not keep records of the environment it is in and would then continue to switch rooms until it hit the lifespan.
B) What about a reflex agent with state? Design Such an agent
	A reflexive agent with state would preform better because it would cause it to keep track of the world that it is in making it so that it will not run until the end of its lifecycle.

	The Agent might look something like this;
	state <- (state, action, percept, model) // This checks the current state of the room and then updates its state model based on the precept of the model
	rule <- (state, rule) //It will then choose a rule based on the given rule set and the current state of the state model
	action <- (rule) //It will execute the action based on the rule set from the previous step

	The Agent for the vacuum example might look like this;
	state : Has a way to track the rooms (A & B) if they are dirty or clean.  It then updates this model based on the current room it is in.
	Rule: checks the state model to make sure both rooms are not clean; if the current room is clean it will then move to the next room. If the current room is dirty then it will clean the room.
	action: based on the rule set above the robot will then execute the action based on the rule set.
	 
C) The answer to part A will not change because it still will not have a way to keep records and will continue to run until the end of its life cycle. The answer to part B will not change but will become better because then the agent will then know the optimal path to move to and act accordingly.
