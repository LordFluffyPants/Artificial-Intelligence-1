To build problem 6 you can run the JAR file and it will print out the search results according to the initial state given in initial_state.csv
If the build is failing go to the source code and change ImportManager.java in the function importInitialState() to point to the correct file path location.
If problem persists (call tech support), the source code takes in an int array, you can just create the array to see how it works as a last resort.
